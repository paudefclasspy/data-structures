## Educational Enhancements

1. **Step-by-step Tutorials**: Add guided tutorials that walk users through each data structure with explanations of core concepts.
2. **Code View**: Show the actual implementation code alongside visualizations so users can connect visual operations with code.
3. **Complexity Visualizer**: Add visual indicators showing how many operations/comparisons are performed during each action to illustrate time complexity.
4. **Algorithm Comparisons**: Allow users to compare different algorithms (e.g., different tree balancing techniques) side by side.
5. **Quiz Mode**: Implement interactive quizzes to test understanding of data structure operations.


## User Experience Improvements

1. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Add theme switching for different user preferences and environments.
2. **Responsive Controls**: Make the visualization controls more accessible on mobile devices.
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations.
4. **Save/Load Functionality**: Allow users to save their current data structure state and load it later.
5. **Customizable Animation Speed**: Let users control how fast or slow the animations run.
6. **Fullscreen Mode**: Add the ability to expand visualizations to fullscreen for presentations.


## Additional Data Structures

1. **AVL Trees**: Implement self-balancing AVL trees to demonstrate tree balancing.
2. **Red-Black Trees**: Add another type of self-balancing tree with different properties.
3. **Heaps**: Implement min and max heaps with visualization of heapify operations.
4. **Trie**: Add prefix tree visualization for string operations.
5. **B-Trees**: Implement B-trees to show how they're used in databases and file systems.
6. **Disjoint Set/Union Find**: Visualize operations like union and find with path compression.


## Technical Improvements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize rendering for larger data structures.
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure all visualizations are accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
3. **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages.
4. **Progressive Web App**: Make the app installable as a PWA for offline use.
5. **URL State Sharing**: Allow users to share specific data structure states via URL.


## Interactive Features

1. **Custom Input Data Sets**: Let users upload or input their own data sets.
2. **Real-world Examples**: Show how each data structure is used in real applications.
3. **Collaborative Mode**: Allow multiple users to interact with the same visualization simultaneously.
4. **Challenge Mode**: Create challenges where users need to build efficient data structures to solve problems.
5. **Performance Benchmarks**: Show performance metrics for different operations across data structures.
